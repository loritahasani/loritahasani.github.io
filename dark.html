            <li> Just got my doctor's test results and I'm really upset about it. Turns out, I'm not gonna be a doctor.</li>
            <br>

            <br>
            <li>  As I get older, I remember all the people I lost along the way. Maybe my budding career as a tour guide was not the right choice.</li>
            <br>
            <li>  I was digging in our garden and found a chest full of gold coins. I wanted to run straight home to tell my wife about it. Then I remembered why I was digging in our garden.</li>
            <br>
            <li>  The doctor gave me some cream for my skin rash. He said I was a sight for psoriasis.</li>
            <br>
            <li>  Don’t challenge Death to a pillow fight. Unless you’re prepared for the reaper cushions.</li>

            <br>
            <li>  Want to know how you make any salad into a caesar salad? Stab it twenty-three times.</li>
            <br>
            <li>  When I see the names of lovers engraved on a tree, I don't find it cute or romantic. I find it weird how many people take knives with them on outings.</li>
            <br>
            <li>  Give a man a match, and he’ll be warm for a few hours. Set him on fire, and he will be warm for the rest of his life.</li>
            <br>

            <li>  How many emo kids does it take to screw in a lightbulb? None, they all sit in the dark and cry.</li>

            <br>
            <li>  They laughed at my crayon drawing. I laughed at their chalk outline.</li>
            <br>
            <li>  My husband and I have reached the difficult decision that we do not want children. If anybody does, please just send me your contact details and we can drop them off tomorrow.</li>
            <br>

            <br>
            <li>  The most corrupt CEOs are the ones who run pretzel companies. They’re always so twisted.</li>
